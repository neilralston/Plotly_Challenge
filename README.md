## Plotly & Belly Button Biodiversity

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide demographic information and visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. 

Specifically, volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. 

That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

Using JavaScript, Plotly, and HTML coding, volunteers can use the dashboard to access the following information about their sample:

* Demographic details
* Top ten bacterial cultures found (bar chart)
* Washing frequency (gauge chart)
* Bacteria cultures per sample (bubble chart)

## Results

Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart

Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart

Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart

Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard

Customized the dashboard with the following Bootstrap elements:
* Added an image to the jumbotron element
* Added bold and italics to jumbotron font to improve legibility against the image
* Added more information about the project as a paragraph on the page
* Changed the paragraph type to "lead" to improve legibility
